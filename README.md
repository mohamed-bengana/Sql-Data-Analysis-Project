# Sql-Data-Analysis-Project
 
This project was developed entirely using SQL, demonstrating my ability to manage the complete data analysis process from start to finish.

I used SQL to explore, clean, and prepare the sales dataset — ensuring accuracy, consistency, and reliability. I then applied advanced SQL techniques to transform and aggregate the data, creating a well-structured SQL view that consolidates all the essential metrics in one place.

The project reflects my strong expertise in SQL and my ability to turn raw business data into clear, organized, and actionable insights — skills that can be applied to real-world company data for better decision-making.
